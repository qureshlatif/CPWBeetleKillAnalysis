### Basic function of each model script in this repository ###
# Note: This readme does not include descriptions of script files in the "archive" folder.

##________ Scripts for peer-reviewed manuscript________##
# Data and tabulation compilation # 
# 00-Compile covariates from JIvan & DPavlacky files.R - Initial covariate compilation from files received from partners
# 00-Data_wrangle.R - Queries raw data from Bird Conservancy database using API. Compiled data are saved in a 'Data_compiled.RDATA' workspace.

# Analysis implementation and compilation of results #
# 01-Analyze_habitat_relations.R - Implements community occupancy model with habitat covariates ("habitat model" in manuscript).
# 01-Analyze_outbreak_relations.R - Implements community occupancy model with outbreak covariates ("outbreak model" in manuscript).
# 01-Analyze_RESQ_outbreak.R - Implements abundance model for red squirrel appearing in nest predator appendix (Appendix S2).
# 01-Covariate_summary_stats.R - Compiles summary statistics for covariates.
# 01-Outbreak_habitat_relations.R - Implements regression analyses relating outbreak with vegetation covariates.
# 02-Analyze_richness_outbreak.R - Compiles and plots model-estimated species richness in relation to outbreak conditions.
